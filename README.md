### Stand Up - 11/01 
Commit and pull request review of initial commit 
Pull request was sizeable, but only due to the installation of various package modules
Git strategy going forward - keeping various branches until we're sure they're not needed anymore
Setup of Merge Request Rules and first pass of coding standards
Agreed use of GitHub issues

### Coding standards
- Variables should be declared with camel casing
- Comment code regularly by describing its purpose, rather than what it does, in plain language for all to read
- Braces should be aligned in a slanted style
- Avoid global variables where possible, use "let"
- Minimise code duplication and unnecessary redundancy
- Use space consistently within code to separate various blocks and 
- Follow DRY standard, don't repeat yourself
- Use versioning control to assist with collaboration


### Merge Request Rules
1. Should be approved by someone other than the person that created the MR
2. Comments should be made on code that does not meet criteria
3. Code should not be merged if it doesn't pass CI/CD pipeline
4. All tests must pass
5. Commit must have relevant description before pushing
6. Check for correct and best coding standards used
7. New code should have corresponding unit tests

### Definiton of Done
- Code has gone through CI/CD pipeline
- All unit tests have passed
- No errors or issues within the code
- All pull requests have been reviewed by members of the team with relevant comments
- Project is well documented with README
